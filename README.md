**WHAT IS FLINT?**

FLINT, the Full Lands Integration Tool, is an open-source platform designed to estimate greenhouse gas emissions and removals from the land sector, with a focus on supporting global climate action and sustainable development goals. Developed through collaboration between Kenya, Australia, and Canada, FLINT incorporates lessons from previous tools like CBM-CFS3 and FullCAM. Key features include a full-mass balance framework meeting IPCC requirements, customization options for national policies, modular design for flexibility, spatially explicit operation, and the ability to generate fine resolution time series data and projections. Managed by Moja Global under the Linux Foundation, FLINT enables countries to progressively develop Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) systems tailored to their needs, starting from basic implementations using global datasets and advancing to more complex approaches with national and regional data. FLINT coordinates data interaction and computational outputs through compatible modules, allowing for different configurations known as implementations, such as SLEEK-FLINT and GCBM, each tailored to specific needs like forest growth modeling.
